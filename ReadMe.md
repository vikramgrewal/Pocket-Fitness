# Pocket Fitness

This is an IOS application that makes tracking your fitness journey easier and more enjoyable than ever.

### Reason for Development
---
As fitness enthusiasts we've found many problems with the applications currently out on the market. The desire to make more "smarter" application has taken away from the people who enjoy simplicity from fitness apps. This app brings back simplicity. This application will allow you to track your workouts and allow you to see progress with visual aids (bar charts, graphs, searchable history), but with an extremely easy user experience.
